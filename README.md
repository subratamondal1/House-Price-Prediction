* **The dataset had no missing values & no duplicate values.**
* **Had outliers, treated them.**
* **Found the top correlated variables :**
    1. **Number of convenience stores**
    2. **latitude**
    3. **longitude**
* **Out of the various models used Random Forest Regressor gave 74.3 % Accuracy with RMSE of 7 and XGBoost Regressor gave 72.2 % Accuracy with RMSE of 7 . They both were the top performer among the other algorithm used.**
* **After Tuning the Hyperparameters the Accuracy Score of Random Forest Regressor increased by almost 2% whereas XGBoost had no improvements.**
